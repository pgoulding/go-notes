## Two Pointers

The **Two Pointers Pattern** is a technique that is used in problem solving to efficiently traverse or manipulate sequential data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. This involves creating two pointers that travers the data structure in a coordinated manner, typically starting from different positions or moving in opposite directions. These pointers dynamically adjust based on speciifc conditions or criteria, allowing for the exploration of data and enabling solutions with opitmal time and space complexity. Whenever there's a requirement to find toew data elements in an arraythat satisfy a certain condition, the Two Pointers Pattern should be the first strategy to come to mind.

Common interview questions for these would be:

- Palindrome
- Remove Duplicates
- Merge Two Sorted Arrays
- Unique Elements in Sorted Array
- Closest Two Sum
- Three Sum
- Four Sum
- Dutch National Flag
- Trapping Rainwater
- Remove Nth Node from End of List

### Palindrome

Write a function that takes a string as an input, and determines whether or not it is a palindrome.

*Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.*

### Two Sum

Given an array (sorted in ascending order) and a target, find if there exists andy pair of elements (`arr[i]`, `arr[j]`) such that their sum is equal to the target.

**Naive Method**: Run two nested loops and check if any of them add up to the target value. 
**Better Approach**: Binary Search using pointers
